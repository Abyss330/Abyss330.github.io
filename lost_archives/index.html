            <h3>Live or Die by Your Actions</h3>
            <p>In the chaos of war, every moment counts. There are no arbitrary rules here—only the real consequences of your actions. With perma-death in play, every decision on the battlefield has weight. If your character falls in combat, they are gone, and you must wait 24 hours before rejoining the fight with a new identity. It's war—make your choices wisely.</p>

            <p>Will you serve honorably in the ranks of your nation’s army, or take desperate measures to survive in the chaos? From infantry soldiers to medics and supply officers, every role matters. Join your comrades, defend your trench, and carry out the orders that could lead to victory—or defeat.</p>

            <h3>Supply & Demand: The Lifeblood of War</h3>
