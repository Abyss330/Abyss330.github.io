        <h1>Background to RP</h1>
        <p>The year is 1914, and Europe stands on the brink of the most devastating conflict in human history. Tensions have been rising between the great powers—Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, France, and Britain—fueled by decades of imperialism, alliances, and militarization. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by a Serbian nationalist is the spark that ignites the fire, plunging the world into a war unlike any ever seen before.</p>
        <p>As the war unfolds, millions of soldiers from all corners of the world are called to arms. Trenches are dug from the English Channel to the Swiss Alps, creating a vast and brutal frontline where soldiers endure unimaginable horrors: artillery bombardments, gas attacks, and deadly charges across no man’s land. The war isn’t just fought on the battlefield—nations mobilize their economies, industries, and civilians in a desperate bid to win. The world is forever changed by this "war to end all wars."</p>
