        <p><strong>Why can’t I shoot or see my gun?</strong>

            <br>
            The use of glitches or exploits, such as ones pertaining to sit anywhere scripts, are punishable by permanent ban from the community. Glitches, exploits, and other issues are encouraged to be reported so they can be patched (if possible).
        </p>
        <p><strong>How do I make money?</strong>
            <br>
            In an open-ended, serious RP style community, there are countless ways to make money. Some methods require input capital or skill to obtain, but being an RP server allows you to use your imagination to develop plots to make money through character interaction.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What are some useful commands to know?</strong>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>/introduce – Introduces yourself to nearby people and allows them to recognize you.</li>
                <li>/act<action> – Performs a specific animation to enhance roleplay</li>
                <li>/r <message> – Talks into the radio via text message.</li>
                <li>/me <description> – Used to describe roleplay context / personal action</li>
                <li>/y <message> – Used to yell to nearby players. (Longer range)</li>
                <li>/w <message> – Used to whisper to nearby players (Short range)</li>
                <li>/looc <message> – Used for local out-of-character messages</li>
                <li>/ooc <message> or // <message> – Used for Out-of-Character messages server-wide.</li>
                <li>/toggleraise – Raises/lowers a weapon you’ve selected. (Weapons by default start lowered when selected)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Where are all the jobs?</strong>
            <br>
            Serious Roleplay, unlike DarkRP derivatives, does not rely on a structured job for each function. Instead, it’s up to the player to decide their place in society.
        </p>
        <p><strong>How many character slots do I get?</strong>
            <br>
            2 slots by default.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Do I have to stay as one character?</strong>
            <br>
            No, you can use ALT characters who may be entirely unrelated (e.g., one character is a cop, another is a criminal). The only stipulation is that you do not have characters that overlap in their activities or knowledge.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Is character death permanent?</strong>
            <br>
            Yes. character death is permanent.
        </p>
        <p><strong>How does New Life Rule work?</strong>
        <br>
        Our server explicitly prohibits revenge killings or acts. When you die, if your character be respawned. Any post-death respawn shall count as a medical revival in which the character will maintain the same general backstory but will have amnesia of all wrongs done to them.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Why is my character unavailable?</strong>
        <br>
        There is permadeath within the server. When a character dies, it is banned from being used.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What is the purpose of Perma-Death?</strong>
            <br>
            <p>Perma-Death coupled with limited character slots which can’t be cleared on a moment’s notice is intended to tie a player to their characters and create a sense of realism. While many servers rely on lengthy rules and FearRP clauses, we find that creating organic FearRP is the best method to go about this. People who invest their time and effort into growing their character will naturally be more cautious and less prone to acts that could result in their death.</p>
