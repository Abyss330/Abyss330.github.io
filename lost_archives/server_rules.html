        <h1>Server Rules</h1>
        <h2>§1 – Role-Play Rules</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Establish and remain in a proper distinct character, to include all name/description guidelines.</strong> Inappropriate, lore breaking, or low effort names/descriptions are not allowed and will be subject to discipline. Staff may utilize discretion to block, restrict or otherwise prohibit the use of names that are deemed in violation, made in bad faith or otherwise ‘gag’ or divisive name. Descriptions must only contain physically observed traits and such traits must be realistic.</li>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Name Guidelines:</li>
                <li>A - Z English Alphabet Letters Only</li>
                <li>No historical figures</li>
                <li>No copy cat names</li>
                <li>No use of slurs or inflammatory language</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Remain in character. While playing, every situation should be properly roleplayed out.</strong>strong Mistakes happen in real life, so it’s okay to RP a mistake that was made. PMs may only be in character if it is roleplayed out as a phone call using /me commands from a phonebooth or desk phone. If you must break character to discuss a matter, use OOC/LOOC/PM/Discord. Discord Direct Messages are ALWAYS considered OOC. Please view the background to RP if you have questions about the setting.</li>
            <li><strong>Mass Deathmatching:</strong> Do not kill lots of players in a short period of time. Repeated RDM of the same player(s) is also not acceptable.</li>
            <li><strong>Transactions are not protected.</strong> You can be scammed or robbed just like in real life. Be careful who you do business with; roleplay it out by calling the police or take justice into your own hands.</li>
            <li><strong>New Life Rule: Our server explicitly prohibits revenge killings or acts.</strong> When you die, if your character be permanent deleted. Any type of ‘revive’ without authorization shall count as a rule break. It is also forbidden to use alt characters or respawn to exact revenge or visit the area of death unless called there by a third party in a role-play sense.</li>
            <li><strong>No Metagaming:</strong> Metagaming is the using of information that is made available by the game that would not be available in the RP context.</strong> This includes but is not limited to: scoreboard information, out of character chats, and other information and private messages.</li>
            <li><strong>No “PATTERN” behaviors.</strong> All characters created should be unique; do not attempt to power game or have a consistent strategy, approach, persona, or otherwise repetitious behaviors that are within a player’s control such as attitudes towards death, money, law, foods, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintain Proper RP.</strong> All scenarios should be roleplayed out; leaving or abandoning a situation is forbidden. Blatant disregard for other people’s roleplay experiences and the server overall is forbidden.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>§2 – Basic Server Rules</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>DO NOT apply other community and server’s rules and roleplay concepts to our server.</strong> Every server has different definitions of RDM, metagaming, new life rule, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not abuse out of character chat. Be respectful to everyone on the server while OOC, including avoiding targeted insults and excessive obscenities.</strong> In-character interactions are exempt from this unless it overly targets a specific player and creates a hostile toxic atmosphere. This is extended to community spaces like Discord.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not exploit or utilize any glitches in the game to gain advantage or otherwise alter gameplay.</strong> Report them. Those who report glitches may receive a show of gratitude and/or compensation.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not advertise other servers & communities.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Do not attempt to compromise the security or the integrity of the server OR attempt to disrupt gameplay.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Never impersonate any of the staff or members.</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>§3 – Enforcement of Rules</h2>
        <p>Enforcement of the rules and server violations must be done within the confines of an offense matching a specific rule violation. There are no exceptions or immunity granted for violations. VIP/Donors/Community Supporters and staff are subject to enforcement just as any other member should there be a violation that warrants corrective action. Progressive discipline is encouraged to include issuance of warnings when possible, but in cases where conduct is disruptive or egregious enough, direct bans may be issued without warning.</p>
        <h2>§4 – Use of logs</h2>
        <p>Server logs are useful tools for the Administration of Lost Archives to investigate claims and review potential issues. The Administration of Lost Archives reserves the right to introduce these logs as evidence to support any rule violation claim. These logs are stored records of everything that has transpired on the server. The Administration may also selectively review the logs from time to time to ensure general compliance with established rules and policies. We are always watching.</p>
        <h2>§5 – Acknowledgement</h2>
